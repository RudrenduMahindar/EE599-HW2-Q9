# EE599-HW2-Q9
Write a function that takes a vector of integers and a number R as the input. The number R specifies the number of times the vector should be rotated. Specifically, to “rotate” a vector by 1 means to move each element in the vector to its next right location, while the right-most element will be moved to the left most position. See also the following examples. Example 1: input: ([1,2,3,4], 1), output: [4,1,2,3] Example 2: input: ([1,2,3,4], 2), output: [3,4,1,2] Example 3: input: ([1,2,3,4], 3), output: [2,3,4,1]) Example 4: input: ([1,2,3,4], 4), output: [1,2,3,4]
